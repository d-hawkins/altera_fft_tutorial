The Altera Burst I/O FFT implements unconditionally scaling by 2-bits, so
the exponent code is never observed to be zero. This unconditional scaling
effectively reduces the signal-to-noise by 2-bits. The impact of this
implementation detail is that that Altera Burst I/O FFT core may need to
be instantiated with a bit-width 2-bits wider than may have been expected.
